Regression Testing:-
---------------------

Regression testing is a software testing process that ensures that new changes to an application don't break existing functionality: 
Purpose
To verify that new features, updates, or changes don't cause issues in the code, such as old bugs reappearing 
Importance
A common issue in software development is that new changes can cause old bugs to reappear. Regression testing helps to ensure that the software maintains its quality and continues to function as expected 
How it works
Regression testing involves re-running tests that were originally scripted when known problems were fixed. This helps to ensure that new changes haven't caused any regressions 
When to perform
Regression testing should be performed after every change to the software
