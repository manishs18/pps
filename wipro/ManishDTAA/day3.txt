Kanban:-
-----------
a visual system that helps teams manage and 
track work as it moves through a process.

founded in toyota orginization --> in the year 1940

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement Agile 
and DevOps software development. 

It requires real-time communication of capacity and 
full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually
 on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state 
 of every piece of work at any time.

keypoints about kanban.
1. visual represenation 
2. limit the work in progress. 
3. increment the work.

   by owner

3. sprint                      3. no sprint 
4. chages can be made          4. changes be made any time
   at the end of the 
   sprint 
==================================================================
lean:-
 
Reducing waste in software development (Muda, Mura, Muri).

Muda
Means wastefulness or activities that don't add value to the customer. 
Muda can increase costs, extend lead times, and decrease quality.

Mura
Means unevenness or irregularities in production processes.
Mura can lead to inefficiencies and quality issues. 
For example, a project might have a low workload at the beginning 
but a high workload at the end. 

Muri
Means overburdening people, machines, or processes. 
can lead to a decline in quality, increased error rates, 
and a higher risk of breakdowns

Sprint Review metting:-
------------------------- 
   -> Spring Review is the crucial part in the agile developement, 
      because scrum team demonstrate the work and get the feedback 
      on the increcemental work which is done during this sprint.
          
          a. showcase the completed work. 
          b. Get the feedback. 
          c. Transprancy and collobaration. (open communication)
          d. identification of changes and improvements.

   a.showcase the completed work:
   ------------------------------- 
        the developement team shows the work completed in this sprint
        to stackholder,product onwer. 

        The demonstration helps to understand the project functionality.
   
   b.Get the feedback: 
   ---------------------- 
       the stackholder can give the feedback, about functionality 
       weather it has meet the requiremnt or not, 
       or any changes needed.

   --------------------------------- 
      ->Sprint review promotes, make transprant collobration.

        in product backlog. 
========================================================================        

Stages in SDLC:-
---------------- 
             plan
              design    ------------>
                  coading   ------------->
                       test    -------------->
                          deploy ----------------->

Collaborate Among Different Team in SDLC:-
--------------------------------------------
1.Requiremnt Gathering Phase:-
  --------------------------- 
      steps 1: Engage stackholder  (client)
                collaborate with the stackholder,end users,and other 
                project member to understand the requirement.

      step 2: Conduct workshop, 
                ->show some sample demo, to get clear understanding,
      
      step 3:Document Requiremnt: 
                Start writing the Requiremnt documentation, by collective 
                understanding of all memeber.

 



2.Design phase:-
 -----------------    
       step 1: collaborate design session:
                   get the ideas from different experts, how the design 
                   should look,

    step 3:- Test Result Report Documentation
    ------  
            After testing the function, maintain a test report for the
            passed test and failed test.

 
  step 4: Defect tracking metting:- 
  ------- 
         -> list out all the defects,   
         -> prioritize the defects based on critical/priority.

           types of testing will be done 
              -> unit testing    ----------------> developer will do this
              -> functional testing   ------------> check for login functionality,  booking functionality,...
              -> integration testing 
              -> system testing 

              User Acceptance Testing:-
