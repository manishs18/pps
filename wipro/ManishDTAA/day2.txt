why we develope the software:-
------------------------------ 
  --> to make the things automate, 
           (or)
     --> to solve real world problem. 
         eg:-
         ---
            booking ticket --> online app 
            booking cab,ticket,food, grocery,...for every thing we have app.

Requirement Gathering:-
---------------------- 
   gathering the requirement from the client.  

Feasibity Study (planning):- Requirement Analysis
----------------------------- 
 resource availiblity. 
 financial study.
 external service --> payment gateway,email service,....

design:-
--------- 
   1. Low level design
   2. High Level design

  High level design: 
  ------------------ 
    morning session     afternoon session  

  low level design: 
  ----------------- 
    morning session                  afternoon session
       --> sdlc                            Agile
       --> sdlc models   


coding:-
-------- 
 -> this is the phase where actually development starts.

    movie booking functionality. 
    movie cancel booking functionality.
     login function --> refer the srs for functionality development 
                              password validation stregth 
                              socail media login
       
       unit testing:-
       -------------- 
          2 + 2 =4

testing:-
---------- 
   It is nothing verfying and validating the software product, 
   weather the customer requirement or not. 

      2.2 + 2 = 4      ----> int
                4.2    ----> float
                4.20
    manual testing. 
    automation testing.   

deployment:- 
   
   developement server. (developer pushes the code)
   testing server. (testing team uses this server, to test the functionality)
   production server.   (live for the end user)

    the product is the deployed to the end user. 


maintanance:- 
   monitor the application, 
   Provide the support when needed.    

====================================================================
what is difference project and product..?

 Product:-
     -------- 
         -> A software is developed for multiple customer. It solves 
         common problem. Then it is product.  

         eg:-
         ---- 
           gmail 
           google drive 
           ms team      ----> mupliple customer are using
           zoom         ---> 

     Project:-
     ---------- 
          -> A Software is developed for single clinet.Based on 
          client requirement it has developed. 

              eg:-
              ---- 
                -> online axis banking-->
                -> rps lms portal 
                -> puma online ecommerce..  

==================================================================== 
different types of sdlc model. 
 1. water fall model. 
 2. agile 
 3. spiral  
 4. v model 
 4. prototype model


1.water fall:-
------------------
  requiremt gathering     -------------------> 1 week     dec 5 2024
     feasibity study (planning)        -------> 0.5 week  
                            design        ----> 1.5 week
                               coding      ----> 10 weeks 
                                  testing   ---> 6 weeks 
                                     deployment   --> 0.2 weeks
                                        maintanance  --> daily



->It is a step by step process.
->we cannot go back to the previous step if requirement changes. 
   (always we need to start from first step)

when we use water fall model...?
---------------------------------- 
  --> It is used in small project. 
  --> only when the requiremnt 100% clear . (well defined).

  eg:-
  ---- 
    alarm app. 
    calculor app 

disadv:-
-------- 
   ->we cannot go back to previous stage. 
   ->It is not useful, when the requirements gets keep changing. 
   ->Testing will start only after developement. 
   ->client can see the demo, only after completing the whole application,


2. Agile:-
------------ 
   It is a iterative incremnetal software development model,
   where the software product developed in sprints. 

   sprint:- duration of time 1 to 4 or 6 weeks. 

   in the sprint a particular product feature is developed. 
 
 whatapp feature:-
 ----------------- 
  chat 
  call 
  group chat 
  community 
  status 
  payment 
  profile 
  location

  sprint 1:    3 weeks
      chat feature    
                 plan-> design->code->testing->deployment -> client review
  
  
  sprint 2 :  2 weeks
      call feature 
            plan-> design->code->testing->deployment -> client review
  
  sprint 3: 
       group chat and call 
          plan-> design->code->testing->deployment -> client review
  
  sprint 4: 
       status

=======================================================================
Techniques for gathering requirements 
         (interviews, surveys, observations).   
   interview --> ask direct questions to the stackholder to get understand about 
                 requirement. 
   surveys  --> conduct survey get the suggestions. 
   observations --> buy seeing observation we can understanding the requirement. 
=======================================================================
what is agile..?
--------------------
Agile is a project management approach that emphasizes 
adaptability, collaboration, and quick delivery over 
following a set plan: 

Adaptability: The ability to respond to change and create in an 
            uncertain environment 

Collaboration: Constant feedback allows team members to adjust to 
            challenges and stakeholders to communicate consistently 

Quick delivery: Projects are completed in short-term development cycles 

Agile is based on the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto. 
It was originally created for software development, but is now used for many different types of projects and organizations


Agile framework.
