Steps to Verify if Recursion is Fixed in GDB

1. Compile the Fixed Code
First, compile the fixed code with debugging symbols:
gcc -g -o fix_error_recursive_logic fix_error_recursive_logic.c

2. Start GDB
Start GDB to debug the program:
gdb ./fix_error_recursive_logic

3. Set a Breakpoint
Set a breakpoint at the beginning of the fixedRecursion function to monitor the recursive calls:
break fixedRecursion

4. Run the Program
Run the program inside GDB:
run
This will start the recursion from fixedRecursion(1).

5. Step Through the Program
As the program runs, step through each recursive call using next to observe how the recursion behaves:
next
Check the value of n in each step to ensure that the function is eventually reaching the base case when n exceeds 10:
print n

6. Verify the Base Case
Ensure that after n exceeds 10, the function correctly exits without making further recursive calls. When the base case is hit (n > 10), the recursion should terminate, and you should see that the program does not recurse further.

7. Inspect the Stack
If needed, you can inspect the call stack to see the state of the recursive calls. This will show if there are any remaining calls on the stack:
backtrace

8. Finish the Program
Once the program reaches the base case and finishes without any further recursion, you can finish the program:
quit
