Steps to Verify the Fix
1. Compile the Fixed Code
Compile the code with debugging symbols:
gcc -g -o fix_track_memory_corruption fix_track_memory_corruption.c

2. Start GDB
Launch GDB with the executable:
gdb ./fix_track_memory_corruption

3. Set Breakpoints
Set breakpoints to observe execution at key points:
At the start of safeFunction:
break safeFunction
Optionally, at the strncpy call to observe memory:
break strncpy

4. Run the Program
Start the program execution:
run

5. Inspect the Memory
After the strncpy call, check if the memory for buffer contains the expected data without overflow:
x/20x &buffer
This will show 20 bytes starting from the address of buffer. Ensure only 9 characters of largeInput and a null terminator are present in buffer.

6. Step Through Execution
Step forward through the function:
next

7. Verify Null Termination
Print the buffer content to confirm null termination:
print buffer
Ensure the string is properly null-terminated (no memory corruption or garbage beyond the content).

8. Inspect Adjacent Memory
Check memory around the buffer to ensure no corruption occurs:
x/40x &buffer - 10
Look for unexpected changes in memory adjacent to buffer.

9. Continue and Check Output
Resume execution to observe the program output:
continue
