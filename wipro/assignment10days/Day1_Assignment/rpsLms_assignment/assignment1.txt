'''Assignment 1:
Pseudocode Development - Task: Write a detailed pseudocode for a simple program that takes a number as input, 
calculates the square if it's even or the cube if it's odd, and then outputs the result. 
Incorporate conditional and looping constructs.
'''

START

# Step 1: Initialize the program
PRINT "Welcome to the Number Processor!"

# Step 2: Input handling with a loop
WHILE True DO
    PRINT "Enter a number (or type 'exit' to quit): "
    INPUT userInput

    # Step 3: Check for exit condition
    IF userInput = "exit" THEN
        PRINT "Thank you for using the program. Goodbye!"
        BREAK

    # Step 4: Validate input
    TRY
        number ← CONVERT userInput TO INTEGER
    CATCH
        PRINT "Invalid input! Please enter a valid number."
        CONTINUE

    # Step 5: Process the number
    IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        result ← number * number
        PRINT "The number is even. Its square is: ", result
    ELSE
        result ← number * number * number
        PRINT "The number is odd. Its cube is: ", result
    ENDIF
