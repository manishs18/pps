Assignment 1: Pseudocode and Flowchart for sorting algorithm - Write pseudocode and create a flowchart for a bubble sort algorithm.
Provide a brief explanation of how the algorithm works and a simple array of integers to demonstrate a dry run of your algorithm. 


#Pseudocode Solution:

START
1. Input array A of size n
2. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for i = 0 to n-1:
    3. Set swapped = False
    4. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for j = 0 to n-i-2:
        5. If A[j] > A[j+1], then:
            a. Swap A[j] and A[j+1]
            b. Set swapped = True
    6. If swapped = False, Exit the loop (array is sorted)
7. Output the sorted array A
END



How the Algorithm Works:
Iterative Pairwise Comparison:

The algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements in the array.
If the current element is greater than the next, they are swapped.
Passes:

The process is repeated for all elements, progressively sorting the larger elements to the end.
Optimization with swapped:

If no swaps occur during a pass, the array is already sorted, and the algorithm stops early.
